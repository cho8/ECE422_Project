If running the client from another directory (as intended), just copy the src folder to that directory and make :)

Run the server: 
- Run makefile in src folder
- java lib.ServerRunner

Run a client (in a seperate window):
- Run makefile in src folder

(some sample client + key pairings)
- java lib.ClientHandler Client1 1827361872 194291 91487 1784619
- java lib.ClientHandler Client2 129048 1249081 89 9035717
